				<p class="date">July 14, 2008</p>
				<h4 class="intro">When I became a dad, I found out many interesting things about life that I'd like to share with you.</h4>
				<ul class="p-list">
					<li>
						<h5>Life Is Full Of Poop</h5>
						<p>We live in a world that has fallen into a deep deception. We walk through a life full of tragedy, disappointment, and heartache. Innocent lives are taken on an hourly basis. Children are stripped of their dreams. Adults are distracted into lives of mediocrity. Much like the treasure I regularly find in Collin's diaper, I see things my brain would rather not see. I smell a stench that has been brought into this world through the lies and deceptions of evil minds. Those that would seek to destroy life and desecrate joy.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>Babies Are Full Of Poop</h5>
						<p>Following this line of realization, I've come to understand that poop keeps coming. Just when I think I've got a good handle on how to overlook and write-off what I see around me, some news feed flashes the latest, greatest atrocity from across the world or down the street. It's getting to the point that I can't watch the news. There is only so much tragedy that a human heart can comprehend, but this world seems dead-set to trump the prior calamity.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>Poop Happens</h5>
						<p>So I've come to the understanding that poop happens. In this life, there are sorrows. If I have the opportunity to wake up tomorrow, I will find joy sprinkled with disappointment; happiness accompanied by sorrow.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<blockquote style="font-style:italic; color:#EB4F4F;">"Wow Roger. That's deep. You're a regular Jack Handy. Can you be anymore depressing?”</blockquote> <p style="padding-top:.5em;">— That's what you're thinking. I know it.</p>

					<h3 class="subhead">The Mystery of the Poopy Diaper</h3>

					<p>It's alright. I wouldn't be impressed either if that was the end of the story. But it's not the end of the story. Allow me to point out some interesting facts I've found about life and poopy diapers.

					<p>As a new dad, I come to realize that I LOVE changing Collin's poopy diapers. Seriously. I love it. My wife and I made it a priority early on to turn this smelly job into a fun time. We didn't want Collin to feel like he had done something bad by pooping. I mean...he has to do it anyway. Eating, sleeping, and pooping are his daily jobs. He does them well; very well. If makes sense to allow him to feel good about a job well done.</p>

					<p>So here we are, making little cooing sounds to Collin while changing his diaper. We tell him how proud we are of him for making us such a big "prize". We smile and laugh and giggle...and change the diaper as quickly as possible.</p>

					<p>Poopy diapers are reminders to me that life can be a challenge. Most days, poop comes…other days it doesn't. What are you going to do with that smelly pile of life. That’s the real test each day. Are you going to be upset? Are you going to get frustrated? It doesn't matter how mad or frustrated you feel. Poopy days keep coming. Are you going to sit in a corner and pout? Believe me - pouting will not stop life’s poop. They will keep coming. You can't ignore them, and trust me, you don’t want to pretend they're not there. (hint…they build up if you do.)</p>

					<p>There’s only one thing you can do with a kid’s poopy diapers - change them…quickly.
					The same principle applies to life’s daily poop fest. You can complain about how messy life is; how smelly your job is; how poopy your (insert person of dissatisfaction here) is being. You can go about life clamoring about the way the world should be...OR...you can change it.</p>

					<p>That's the wonderful mystery of the poopy diaper. When it's changed, you've made all things new. Life now has a clean, fresh bottom and you can be a very happy baby. Peace, joy, and contentment all come with that changed diaper. The same can be said of a changed life.</p>

					<p>God often reminds me that He's in the diaper changing business. He's my Father as I am Collin's. He knows my life is smelly… and messy... and in serious need of a change. So here He is...changing my life one smelly mess at a time; all the while, laughing...cooing...and telling me how proud He is of me of the big “prize” I gave Him.</p>

					<p>When it's all said and done, my life is changed and my mind cleansed. And much like Collin after a diaper change, I can safely fall asleep in the arms of a loving Father - content and peaceful that the world is not
